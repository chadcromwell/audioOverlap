To use audioOverlap all you need to do is include audioOverlap.js or audioOverlap.min.js in your HTML or PHP file.

***Music***
* To add music, call the addMusic() function and add the music files you desire. Ex: addMusic("song1", "path/to/file.mp3");

* To set the first track that gets played, call setFirstTrack(). Ex: setFirstTrack("song1");

* To start playing music, call playMusic(). This initializes the music and it starts playing.

* To toggle music (play or pause, depending on the current state) call the toggleMusic() function.

* To disable shuffle, call shuffleOff(). This will cause the tracks to be played in the order in which they were added.

* To enable shuffle, call shuffleOn(). This will cause the tracks to be shuffled, the same song will not be repeated twice in a row.
  Shuffle is already enabled by default, there is no need to call it if you have not called shuffleOff().

***Sound Effects***
* To add sound effects, call the addSFX() function, add the sound effect you desire, and set the number of times the sound effect can overlap.
  Do not go overboard with the overlap amount. Only use what you really need. Even 10 is overkill for most instances. Ex: addSFX("sound1", "path/to/file.wav", 4);

* To play sound effects, call the playSFX() function. Ex: if you want to play the "sound1" effect, call playSFX("sound1"); and it will play one of the available
  "sound1" effects from the sound effect pool.

* To toggle sound effects on or off, call the toggleSFX() function.
